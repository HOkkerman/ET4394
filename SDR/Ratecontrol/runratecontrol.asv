%This file is used to run ratecontrol.m with specific input settings.
%Ratecontrol.m is the same file as TransmitRateControlExample.m, except its
%contents are turned into a large function. Some settings that control the
%wireless channel can be set as inputs which eases simulating many
%different channel types.

%TODO: Put the rate control algorithm in its own separate function to ease
%editing and changing algorithms
