I would like you to design your own rate control algorithm for IEEE 802.11 (automatic selection of rate and coding scheme). To start with this assignment please start with the example 'TransmitRateControlExample.m' file from the WLAN systems toolbox in MATLAB. The proposed algorithm is defined in lines 219-223. Your task is to find you own algorithm which will be better than... the one proposed by the rest of the groups in the class. The metric that will assess the performance of your design will be the average throughput and packet error rate. Your algorithm will be tested for the channel setup I will define after the deadline (e.g. defined in lines 44-65 of the 'TransmitRateControlExample.m' example). So to be sure you will beat the rest you will have to explore all possible channel setups like number of TX/RX spatial streams, propagation model, distances, etc. (and understand them) when designing your algorithm. For the next week consultation I would like you to be able to explain to me how the original algorithm in the original example is working. Please have initial ideas for your design ready. Good luck - really looking forward to your solutions! Remarks: Your control algorithm should be a closed-loop rate control scheme. In the final report I would like to see the rationale behind your algorithm and a full evaluation on a large set of input parameters.
